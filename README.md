# Auditorium_System
Auditorium System with JavaFX and SQLite.
In this project, there are 2 options for login.
One of these is "admin entrance" to control how much income is earned, 
how many tickets are sold. Also admin can add and delete conferences, 
sessions and seats.
The second option is "customer entrance" to buy auditorium tickets.
